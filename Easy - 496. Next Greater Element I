The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array. You are given two distinct 0-indexed 
integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. 
If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

What we understood from the question ?

1. We are provided with two arrays nums1 and nums2 , where nums1 is the subset of nums2.
2. For every numbers in nums1, we need to check the greatest element in nums2. how do we check that? - Find the nums1 element in nums2 and check for its next greater
elemnts.. If the value is greater, then append that to result array or else append -1
3. Return the output array

Example : [18,7,6,12,15]

Next greater element of [18] is -1
Next greater element of [7] is -1
Next greater element of [6] is 12
Next greater element of [12] is 15
Next greater element of [15] is -1

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]

Approach 1: Brute Force

1. Initialize the result array with all elements as [-1] and to the length of nums1
    result = [-1] * len(nums1)

2. Iterate through nums1 and identify its index value in nums2
   
   for i in range(len(nums1)):
        k = nums2.index(nums1[i])
        
    output : 2 0 3   # [2 is the index of 4, 0 is the index of 1 and 3 is the index of 2]
    
3. Now iterate through nums2 and check if nums2[j] > nums1[i]. If true , store the nums2[j] in the result and break.
   
   for j in range(i+1, range(len(nums2))):
        if nums2[j] > nums1[j]:
              result[i] = nums2[j]
              break
    return result
    
TC is O(n^2) - Since we are using nested for loops and iterating through both nums1 and nums2
SC is O(n) - since we are using an result array to store the output values

Complete Code:
# Brute Force Approach- O(n^2) and O(1)
        result = [-1]* len(nums1)
        
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            k = nums2.index(nums1[i]) # K gets the index of numbers from nums2
            for j in range(k+1,len(nums2)):
                if nums2[j] > nums1[i]:
                    result[i] = nums2[j]
                    break
        return result

 Approach 2: Using Hahsmap 
 
 TC will be O(n*m) and SC will be O(n)
 
 hash = {n:i for i,n in enumerate(nums1)}
        result = [-1]* len(nums1)
        
        for i in range(len(nums2)):
            if nums2[i] not in hash:
                continue
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums2)):
                if nums2[j] > nums2[i]:
                    index = hash[nums2[i]]
                    result[index] = nums2[j] 
                    break
        return result

 Approach 3: Optimized using Stack
 
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]

Doing the Dry run:
1. First initialize empty stack and dictionary. Dictionary is used here to store the element and its next greatest element. Eg { 1:3 }
2. Now iterate through nums2 and push first element to stack
   
   stack = [1]
 
 3. Now next element is 3. We are allowed to push only the elements that are smaller than top (1) , or else pop out the element
    3 is greater than 1. so pop out top element (1) and add that to dictionary.
    
    stack = []   , dict = { 1:3 }
    
 4. Now push 3 into stack
 
    stack = [3] , dict = {1:3}

5. Now next element is 4. Here , 4 is greater than 1 ,so pop out 3 and append its greatest value to dictionary
 
    stack = [] , dict = { 1:3 , 3:4 }
 
6. Now push 4 into stack. 
   
   stack = [4] , dict = { 1:3 , 3:4 }
 
7. Next element is 2 and 2 is smaller than 4 , so it can pushed into stack and there is no greater element for this. 

   stack = [4,2] , dict = { 1:3 , 3:4 }

8. We have no more element , so pop each item from stack and set the value as -1. 
   
   stack = [] , dict = ( 1:3, 3:4, 2:-1, 4:-1 }
 
9. Finally use dict.get () to return the values of nums1 

TC is o(n) - The entire nums2 array (of size n) is scanned only once. Each of the stack's nn elements are pushed and popped exactly once. 
SC is O(n) - map will store nn key-value pairs while stackstack will contain at most nn elements at any given time.

Complete Code:

class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        # Using Stack
        dict = {}
        stack = []
        
        for i in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1] < i:
                k = stack.pop()
                dict[k] = i
            stack.append(i)
            
        return [dict.get(i,-1) for i in nums1]
