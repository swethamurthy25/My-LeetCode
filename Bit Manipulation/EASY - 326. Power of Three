Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 33

Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.

Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).

Constraints:
-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
