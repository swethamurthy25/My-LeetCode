Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list.
Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the MyLinkedList class:

MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
- int get(int index) --> Return the node value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
- void addAtHead(int val) --> Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the 
  linked list.
- void addAtTail(int val) --> Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
- void addAtIndex(int index, int val) --> Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, 
  the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. [Add value at specific index , if the
  index is invalid , it will do nothing]
- void deleteAtIndex(int index) --> Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid. [Delete the node at specific index , if index is invalid , it
  will do nothing]

What we understood from question?

- We have to design a linked list from scratch , it can be either singly linked list or doubly linked list
- We have to perform 6 operations - Initialize the linked list , get value , addAtHead , addAtTail , addAtIndex , deleteAtIndex
- In singly linked list , addAtHead operation can be done at constant time O(1) and addAtTail operation can be done at linear time O(N)
- In doubly linked list , both addAtHead and addAtTail can be done at constant time O(1)

Let us see with an example:
Linked List = [1,2,3,4,null]
Index value = [0,1,2,3]

get(0) --> Return value at 0th index , we have node at 0th index , so return 1 as output
get(4) --> Return value at 4th index , we donot have 4th index , so return -1

addAtHead(5) --> This function will add the value 5 before head and the node will val 5 will become the head
                  Linkedlist = [5,1,2,3,4,null]
                  Index = [0,1,2,3,4]
                  
addAtTail(6) --> This function will add the value 6 at tail and tail with val 6 will be pointing to null
                  Linkedlist = [5,1,2,3,4,6,null]
                  Index = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
