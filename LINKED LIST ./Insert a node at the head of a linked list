Given a pointer to the head of a linked list, insert a new node before the head. The next value in the new node should point to head and the data value should be 
replaced with a given value. Return a reference to the new head of the list. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example: 1--> 2 --> 3 --> null
Suppose if we need to insert value 5 at head
output: 5 --> 1--> 2 --> 3 --> null

Approach 1:

1. Current node is pointing to head
2. Initialize the new node and its value
3. If we add the new node at head , the next reference of new Node should point to existing head
4. Then change the new node as head.
5. Return the head

def insertNodeAtHead(head, data):
    newNode = SinglyLinkedListNode(data)
    newNode.next = head
    head = newNode    
    return head
