This is an to practice traversing a linked list. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print each node's  element, one per line. 
If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), there is nothing to print.

Logic:
1. First check whether the head is not null.
2. If true , print head.data or head.val
3. And head.next to traverse to the next node.


# Complete the printLinkedList function below.

#
# For your reference:
#
# SinglyLinkedListNode:
#     int data
#     SinglyLinkedListNode next
#

def printLinkedList(head):
    while head is not None:
        print(head.data)
        head = head.next
