Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length. Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, 
added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2. Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Things to note down here:
1. It should be solved in constant Memory O(1)
2. It is an one indexed array means indexes will start from 1,2,3,.. not from 0
3. Non decreasing order - means it is sorted from smallest to biggest

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]


Approach 1: Brute Force
We can apply Two Sum's solutions directly to get O(n^2)time, O(1) space using brute force 
We can apply hashtable solution to get O(n) time, O(n) space using hash table. 
However, both existing solutions do not make use of the property that the input array is sorted.

Approach 2: Optimized solution using Two Pointer
1. Initialize two pointers i and j which points first and last element respectively.
2. Add elements pointed by i and j and then compare with target.
3. If target is larger, it means you have added a smaller value and we need to pick next big value. So we increment 'i`.
4. If target is smaller, it means you have added a larger element and it needs to be cut off. So we decrement j.
5. We repeat step 2 and 3 until i>=j or a match is found.

TC is O(n)- The input array is traversed at most once.
SC is O(n)- We only use additional space to store two indices and the sum

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        n = len(numbers)
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        
        while i<j:
            if numbers[i]+numbers[j] == target:
                return [i+1,j+1]
            elif numbers[i]+numbers[j] < target:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        
        return []
