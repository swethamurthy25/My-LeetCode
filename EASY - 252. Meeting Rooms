Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true

____________________________________________

Approach 1: Brute Force

The straight-forward solution is to compare every two meetings in the array, and see if they conflict with each other (i.e. if they overlap). 
Two meetings overlap if one of them starts while the other is still taking place.
