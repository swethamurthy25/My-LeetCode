A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.
Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

____________________________________________

For Example:

Check the number of balanced parantheses - means should have both opening followed by the closing parantheses
S = (P((Q)) ((S)T))

P - 2 balanced
Q - 3
S - 3 and T - 2

Taking maximum , the output is 3

___________________________________________________________

Approach 1 - Without using any datastructure

1. Initialize two variables to store count and max value
2. Traverse through the string , if i == "(" open parantheses , increment the count by 1
3. Check which is the maximum one - depth or the max_count
4. If i == ")" , decrement the count by 1
5. Return the max_count as output

TC is O(n) and SC is o(1)

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        mx_count = 0
        depth = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == "(":
                depth += 1
                mx_count = max(depth,mx_count)
            elif i == ")":
                depth -= 1
            
        return mx_count
                    
___________________________________________________________________

Approach 2 - Using Stack

1. Initialize the empty stack and max_depth = 0
2. for evry character in stack, if it is open parantheses , append that to the stack (push)
3. Else if it is a closing parantheses , pop out from stack 
4. When poping out , "()" is considered as one count , so same way calculate the max count
4. Finally check the max value of (max_value and length of the stack)
5. Return the max_value

TC is O(n) and SC is o(n)

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # Using stack
        stack = []
        max_count = 0
        
        for ch in s:
            if ch == "(":
                stack.append(ch)
            elif ch == ")":
                stack.pop()
            max_count = max(max_count, len(stack))
            
        return max_count
