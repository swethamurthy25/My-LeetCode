You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

Input: coordinates = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]
Output: true

Input: coordinates = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]]
Output: false

Constraints:
2 <= coordinates.length <= 1000
coordinates[i].length == 2
-10^4 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^4
coordinates contains no duplicate point.

Basic Understanding:
- We are given with a set of x and y co-ordinates and we need to return TRue if the co-ordinates forms the straight line , or else return False
- Now before jumping into the solution , we should be aware of the normal math/geometry solution of how the straight line is formed with these points?. Based on that , we 
  can proceed with the coding part.
- First , basically we need atleast two co-ordinates and if we are given with only two co-ordinates ofcourse it will form a straight line , so we need to cover 
  the edge case here if coordinates < 2: return False
- Then , find the slope of two co ordinates -
For example: [[1,2],[2,3] ----> The slope formula is rise/run ie y2-y1/x2-x1
The slope is (3-2)/(2-1) , which is 1 here.
- If we have more than two co ordinates , then the slope of every two co ordinates should be the same, in order to form a straight line.

SOLUTION:
- First cover the edge cases: if coordinates < 2: return False or if coordinates == 2: return True
- Compute the slope of first two points.
- Then compare and check if the next slopes are equal to the first slope.
- If they are not equal , they are not forming a straight line so return False , else return True
