Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. 
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. 
More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave 
beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Understanding of Question:
- We will be given with an input array in sorted manner , we need to remove the duplicates from it.
- We are allowed to have two duplicates , any number more than that has to be removed.
- Only the duplicate is removed in between the array , the remaining rest of the numbers has to be moved forward and last spaces should be left empty.
- We are not allowed to create any additional array or list , we need to all these operations in-place.

For example:
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3] - Here the nums[i] = 1 has to be removed bcz it is coming thrice , 
so when we remove the third 1 , the array will become like this: [1,1,_,2,2,3]
Now we should move the remaining numbers forward : [1,1,2,2,3,_]
