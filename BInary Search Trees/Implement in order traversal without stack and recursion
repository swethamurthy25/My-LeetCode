Implement in order traversal without stack and recursion

Solution:
Inorder Traversal = [left,root,right]
Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion. 
In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to restore original tree.

PSEUDOCODE of InOrder Traversal:

inorder(root)
    if root
        inorder(root--> left)
        visit(root)
        inorder(root--> right)
    return


inorder(root):
if root(
1. Define a function to perform Morris Traversal
2. Initialize current as root 
3. While current is not NULL
   If the current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
4. Else: Find rightmost node in current left subtree OR node whose right child == current.
