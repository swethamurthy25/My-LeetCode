You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions 
are met: Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

Conditions:
i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.

Things to note down:
1. Input array is in strictly increasing order , means its sorted from lowest to highest , so sorting will not be required
2. The integer difference should only be positive
3. Output should be int ( number of unique triplets )

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.
